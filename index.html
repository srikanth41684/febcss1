    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS Stands for Cascading Style Sheet.</li><br>
        <li>CSS discribes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, on in other media.</li><br>
        <li>
            <span class="third-line1">Css is not nessesary </span>
            <span class="third-line2">CSS is saves lot of work. </span>
            It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
        </li><br>
        <li class="fourth-line">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul class="speces">
        <li>inline - By using the style attributes inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - By using a style elements in the head section</li>
        <li>External - By using a link element to link to an external css file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles inexternal css files. However, <span class="third-line2">in this tutorial we will use inline and external styles,</span> because this is easier to demonastrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is the CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or rang of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide rang of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
